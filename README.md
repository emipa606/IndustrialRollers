Industrial Rollers lets you build your own roller system which will transport goods to their destination without colonist interaction.

Simply add a stockpile on top of the rails and direct your roller system to stockpiles.
Items will then be automatically carried to the desired destination. 
Add roller pushers to scan goods and redirect them to different rollers. 

# FAQ

**- Unable to place rollers anywhere but in water: ** change your mod order to have [u]Industrial Rollers[/u] BEFORE any water related mods (bridges, water power, etc...)
